# LeadScreenAppIOS

An app written by our student programmers is already out there.  But NYS Dept Health just updated their guideline on lead screening and treatment for children in the state of NY, so the app needs to be rebuilt.  One could amend the current app, but it would really be better to build a new one from scratch to accommodate all the updated iOS screen sizes and coding specifications to last well into the future.
